# Scratch Starter Project

This project is a web-based clone of MIT's Scratch, a visual programming language designed to help kids and beginners learn programming through drag-and-drop blocks. The goal of this project is to replicate the core features of Scratch with some customizations and enhancements.

## To get started:

1. Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` and open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to see the app.

## Features

- **Sprite Movement**: Move sprites using blocks like "Move", "Turn", "Goto", and "Repeat".
- **Customizable Sprites**: Add your own sprites, drag actions to them, and control their movement and behaviors.
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Use a drag-and-drop interface to manipulate sprite actions and set properties.
- **Interactive Environment**: Preview your sprite interactions in a dedicated preview area.
- **Easy to Understand UI**: A user-friendly interface with visually distinct blocks and intuitive controls.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Jotai**: A state management library used to manage application state like sprite positions, actions, and more.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the logic behind the sprite movements, actions, and UI interactions.
- **HTML5**: The basic structure of the app.
